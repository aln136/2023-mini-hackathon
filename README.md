# 2023-mini-hackathon

Welcome to our project!

This project was inspired by crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter and GoFundMe. It is a lending platform in which users, once registered, can apply for loans or lend money to others. Users may submit loan applications, which will then become visible to other users on a public feed. They may browse this feed and choose to lend money to prospective borrowers. Once the money is lent, borrowers will have a set monthly payment, and must repay the loan within a certain amount of time. This websie is built with HTML, styled with CSS and JS, and connected to an SQL database for data storage.
